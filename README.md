COVID-19 X-ray Image Diagnostic with Deep Neural Networks

Abstract. The COVID-19 pandemic impacted all spheres of our society.
The outbreak increased the pressure on public health systems, urging the
scientific community to develop and evaluate methods to reliably diag-
nose patients. Driven by their effectiveness in medical imaging analysis,
deep neural networks have been seen as a possible alternative to automat-
ically diagnose COVID-19 patients from chest X-rays. Despite promising
initial results, most analyses so far have been performed in small and
under-represented datasets. Considering this, in this work, we evaluate
state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architectures proposed in
recent years by the deep learning field on images from COVIDx [24], a
dataset consisting of 13, 975 chest X-ray from COVID-19, pneumonia,
and healthy patients. In our experiments, we investigate the effect of
data pre-processing steps and class unbalancing for this task. Our best
model, an ensemble of several networks, achieved an accuracy above 93%
in the testing set, showing promising results in a challenging dataset.
